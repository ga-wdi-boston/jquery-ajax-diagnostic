# jQuery AJAX Diagnostic

Place your answers inside the fenced code-blocks where indicated by comments.

For all responses,  assume you have already defined a `logResponseBody` handler
to output your results to the console on success, and that you have a
`logRequestError` to print any errors that occur to the console if the request
fails.

For all responses, you need to include the proper flags for `curl`. You are
expected to use the appropriate HTTP method, and to ask `curl` to include HTTP
headers in its output.

## Request a Collection Resource

Suppose we have an API serving donuts. We want to get a list of all donuts in
the system. In other words, we want to `GET /donuts`. The hostname of the
machine serving the donuts is `http://www.example.com`.

Write the `curl` request you'd use to retrieve a list of all donuts on the
server.

```sh
curl --request --include GET http://www.example.com```

Write an AJAX request to retrieve a list of all donuts on the server.

```js
let getDonuts = $.get(http://www.example.com/data)
```

## Request a Single Resource

Now, we want to get a single donut from the server. Write the `curl` request
you'd use to retrieve a single donut, using whatever ID you'd like.

```sh
curl --include --request GET "http://www.example.com/$ID"
Write an AJAX request to retrieve a single donut from the server.

```js
let getDonut = function (form) {
  let data = getFormFields(event.target);
  return $.ajax({
    url: app.host + '/donuts/' + data.donuts.id,
    method: 'GET',
    data: data
  });
};;;
```

## Delete a Single Resource

Write the `curl` request you'd use to delete a single donut, using whatever ID
you'd like.

```sh
curl --include --request DELETE http://www.example.com/donuts/$ID
```

Write an AJAX request to delete a single donut from the server.

```js
let deleteDonut = function (form) {
  let data = getFormFields(event.target);
  return $.ajax({
    url: app.host + '/donuts/' + data.donuts.id,
    method: 'DELETE',
    data: data
  });
};;;
```

## Create a Single Resource

Write the `curl` request you'd use to create a single donut. Use the following
data in JSON format.

```json
{
  "name": "French Cruller",
  "price": "$0.99"
}
```

```sh
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" "server:5050/a/c/postName{"name":"French Cruller", "price": "0.99" }"```

Write an AJAX request to create a single donut on the server using JSON.

```js
$.ajax({
            type: "POST",
            dataType: 'json',
            url: "http://example.com",
            async: false,
            contentType: "data/donuts; charset=utf-8",
            success: function (msg) {
                console.log(msg);
            }
 });;
```

## Change a Single Resource

We don't want to sell French Crullers anymore. We've got a new German supplier,
so we need to change the name of the Cruller in our database. It has an ID of
`42`.

Write the `curl` request you'd use to change the donut. We'll send the following
JSON.

```json
{
  "name": "Kr√ºller"
}
```

```sh
curl --include --request PATCH http://localhost:3000/books/$42```

Write an AJAX request to change the donut on the server using JSON.

```js
let changeDonut = $.ajax({
            type: "PATCH", 
            dataType: 'json',
            url: "http://example.com/data/donuts",
            async: false,
            contentType: "data/donuts; charset=utf-8",
            success: function (msg) {
                console.log(msg);
            }
 });;
```
