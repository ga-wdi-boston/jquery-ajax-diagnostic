# jQuery AJAX Diagnostic

Place your answers inside the fenced code-blocks where indicated by comments.

For all responses,  assume you have already defined a `logResponseBody` handler
to output your results to the console on success, and that you have a
`logRequestError` to print any errors that occur to the console if the request
fails.

For all responses, you need to include the proper flags for `curl`. You are
expected to use the appropriate HTTP method, and to ask `curl` to include HTTP
headers in its output.

## Request a Collection Resource

Suppose we have an API serving donuts. We want to get a list of all donuts in
the system. In other words, we want to `GET /donuts`. The hostname of the
machine serving the donuts is `http://www.example.com`.

Write the `curl` request you'd use to retrieve a list of all donuts on the
server.

```sh
curl --include --request GET 'http://www.example.com/donuts'
```

Write an AJAX request to retrieve a list of all donuts on the server.

```js
let getDonuts = function (event) {
  event.preventDefault();


// listing all donuts
  donutsApi.index()
        .done(logResponseBody)
        .fail(logRequestError);
}
};
};

const index = function(){
  return $.ajax({
    method: 'GET',
    url: app.host + '/donuts'
  });
};



```

## Request a Single Resource

Now, we want to get a single donut from the server. Write the `curl` request
you'd use to retrieve a single donut, using whatever ID you'd like.

```sh

curl --include --request GET "http://www.example.com/donuts$ID"

```

Write an AJAX request to retrieve a single donut from the server.

```js
let getDonut = function (event) {

  event.preventDefault();

  let donutId = $('.donut-id').val();

  donutsApi.show(donutId)
         .done(logResponseBody)
         .fail(logRequestError);

};


const show = function (id) {
  return $.ajax({
      method: 'GET',
      url: app.host + '/donuts/' + id
  });

};

```

## Delete a Single Resource

Write the `curl` request you'd use to delete a single donut, using whatever ID
you'd like.

```sh
curl --include --request DELETE "http://www.example.com/donuts/3"
```

Write an AJAX request to delete a single donut from the server.

```js

let deleteDonut = function (event) {
  event.preventDefault();

let donutId = $('.donut-id').val();

  donutsApi.destroy(donutId)
  .done(logResponseBody)
  .fail(logRequestError);
};

const destroy = function (donutId) {
  return $.ajax({
    url: app.host + '/donuts/' + donutId,
    method: 'DELETE',
  });
};

```

## Create a Single Resource

Write the `curl` request you'd use to create a single donut. Use the following
data in JSON format.

```json
{
  "name": "French Cruller",
  "price": "$0.99"
}
```

```sh
curl --include --request GET "http://www.example.com/donuts$ID" \
 --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
 --data "{
    \"donuts\": {
    \"name\": \"$NAME\",
    \"price\": \"$PRICE\"
    }
 }"

```

Write an AJAX request to create a single donut on the server using JSON. Please
do not use `data = getFormFields(form)` instead write out the data object.

```js
let createDonut = /* your answer here */;
```

## Change a Single Resource

We don't want to sell French Crullers anymore. We've got a new German supplier,
so we need to change the name of the Cruller in our database. It has an ID of
`42`.

Write the `curl` request you'd use to change the donut. We'll send the following
JSON. Please do not use `data = getFormFields(form)` instead write out the data
object.

```json
{
  "name": "Kr√ºller"
}
```

```sh
# your answer here
```

Write an AJAX request to change the donut on the server using JSON.

```js
let changeDonut = /* your answer here */;
```
